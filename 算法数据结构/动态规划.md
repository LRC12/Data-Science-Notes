## Dynamic Programming

The structure of dynamic programming problem

- Overlapping subproblems: the problem can be broken down into smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times
- Optimal substructures: an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem.

Two way to solve dynamic programming

- Top-down: also known as memoization. A top-down implementation is usually much easier to write. This is because with recursion, the ordering of subproblems does not matter, whereas with tabulation, we need to go through a logical ordering of solving subproblems.
- Bottom-up: also known as tabulation. A bottom-up implementation's runtime is usually faster, as iteration does not have the overhead that recursion does.

Characteristic of dynamic programming

- Optimum value: DP problems will ask for the optimum value (maximum or minimum) of something, or the number of ways there are to do something.

- Dependency: future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions. Deciding to do something at one step may affect the ability to do something in a later step.

Top-down to Bottom-up

- State the subproblem
- Give the recurrence
- Give the boundary conditions
- Give the order to fill in the dp table
- Analyze the time and space complexity
