## Linear Programming

### Fundamentals

Input:

- a set of variables
- a set of linear constraints on the variables
- a linear objective function to maximize

Output:

- an assignment of real values to the variables such that the constraints are satisfied and the objective function is maximized of minimized

-  The optimum is achieved at a vertex of the feasible region, except for the infeasible linear program and unbounded optimum value

### Duality

- Weak duality: $V_P\le V_D$
- Strong duality: $V_P=V_D$

Linear Programming problem can be rewrite as follows

- a maximization or a minimization problem
- all constraints are inequalities in the same direction
- all variables are non-negative

$$
max_{\bold x\ge 0}\ \ \bold c^T\bold x
$$

$$
s.t.\ \ \bold A\bold x\le \bold b
$$

The dual problem can be given as follows
$$
min_{\bold y\ge 0}\ \ \bold b^T\bold y
$$

$$
s.t.\ \ \bold A^T\bold y\ge \bold c
$$

7-step to formulate a LP to its dual LP problem

- Work with a minimization problem
- Rewrite the LP in $\le$ and $=$ form
- Introduce the dual variables, non-negative for inequality constraint and unrestricted for equality constraint
- Maximize the sum of objective function and multiplication of dual variables and constraints
- Group terms by primal variables
- Eliminate the primal variables to ge the dual LP
- Formulate the dual problem

## Integer Programming

An NP problem

given a system of linear inequalityies in n variables and m constraints with integer coefficients and a integer target value k, does it have an integer solution of value k?
$$
max\ \ \bold c^T\bold x
$$

$$
s.t.\ \ \bold A\bold x\le \bold b
$$

$$
\bold x \in \bold Z^n
$$
