## Dynamic Programming

The structure of dynamic programming problem

- Overlapping subproblems
- Easy to compute recurrence
- Interative, bottom-up computations
- Small number of subproblems

The way to solve dynamic programming

- State the subproblem
- Give the recurrence
- Give the boundary conditions
- Give the order to fill in the dp table
- Analyze the time and space complexity
